# CSE722 Project — Encrypted Chat Application (RSA + AES-256)

## Overview
This project is a **two-way encrypted chat application** built in Python for the CSE722 Applied Cryptography course.  
It demonstrates the use of:
- **RSA-2048** for secure public key exchange.
- **AES-256 (CFB mode)** for encrypting chat messages after key exchange.
- **TCP sockets** for communication.
- **Wireshark** for verification.

---

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to implement **hybrid encryption** in a real-time chat environment:
- **Asymmetric encryption (RSA)** is used to securely exchange a randomly generated symmetric key.
- **Symmetric encryption (AES)** is used for all subsequent communication for speed and efficiency.
- **Wireshark** is used to confirm that messages after the handshake are encrypted.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.13
- **Libraries:** [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/), socket, threading
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Algorithms:** RSA-2048 (OAEP, SHA-256), AES-256 (CFB mode)
- **Verification:** Wireshark

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/encrypted-chat-cse722.git
   cd encrypted-chat-cse722
   
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install cryptography

## Usage

### 1️⃣ Start the Server

python client.py
# Start as (server/client)? server
# Port to listen on [default 9999]: 50000


### 2️⃣ Start the Client

python client.py
# Start as (server/client)? client
# Enter server IP: 127.0.0.1   (or LAN IPv4 if on separate devices)
# Server port [default 9999]: 50000

## Commands Inside Chat
- 'sendkey' → Exchange RSA public keys (plaintext in Wireshark)
- 'sendaes' → Send AES-256 key encrypted with peer's RSA public key
- Any other text → Sends AES-256 encrypted message
- 'quit' → Close connection

---

## Verifying Encryption with Wireshark
1. **Start Wireshark** and select:
   - **Npcap Loopback Adapter** (for local testing) or your **Wi-Fi/Ethernet adapter** (for two devices)
2. Apply filter:
   
   tcp.port == 50000
 
   *(Replace 50000 with your chosen port)*
3. Capture:
   - **Before Encryption**: Run sendkey, then view packet in **Follow → TCP Stream** → RSA public key will be visible.
   - **After Encryption**: After sendaes, send a message → ciphertext will be unreadable.
